# SlimeVRTracker

This is for the carrier board for the SlimeVR Tracker at https://docs.slimevr.dev/

The files were designed and exported in Fritzing https://fritzing.org/

There are 3 sets of jumper pads on the back of the board. If you are using an MPU IMU, you will need to solder the left two pads together of the right hand triple pad. It's labled MPU under it. If you're using a BNO IMU, you will need to solder the right two pads of the right hand triple pad, and the both pairs of the other two pads. These are to route the correct signals to the Aux board.
